## CA216 CPU Scheduling

CA216 CPU Scheduler. This repo contains my implementation of the following 4 scheduling algorithms written in Python3:

      •	First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
      •	Shortest Job First (SJF)
      •	Priority Scheduling
      •	Round Robin
      
Each algorithm had to sort a text file of any number of tasks with given priority and buffer as well as a given quantum for Round Robin. 

The program also contains:

		• a driver for displaying the information gathered.
		• a data script to collect the turnaround time and wait times of each algorithm
		• built-in error handling
